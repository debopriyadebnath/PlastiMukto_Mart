## Challenges Faced During Development

*1. AI Integration & Accuracy:*
Integrating the Gemini AI for waste analysis was complex. We had to optimize image upload handling, manage API rate limits, and tune the prompts to improve detection accuracy. Ensuring the AI could reliably identify different types of plastic waste required extensive testing and dataset refinement.

*2. Real-Time Bounty & Leaderboard System:*
Building a dynamic bounty system that tracks user actions and updates leaderboards in real time involved designing efficient database queries and handling concurrency. We faced challenges in ensuring data consistency, especially when multiple users completed bounties simultaneously.

*3. Authentication & Security:*
Implementing secure authentication with Supabase while maintaining a seamless user experience was tricky. We had to address issues with session management, password resets, and protecting sensitive user data.

*4. Marketplace & Vendor Management:*
Creating a flexible marketplace for eco-friendly products required robust CRUD operations, image handling, and vendor authentication. We encountered edge cases with product listings, file uploads, and reward redemption flows.

*5. Environment & API Key Management:*
Managing environment variables and API keys securely for both local development and deployment was a challenge. We had to ensure keys were not exposed and that the app could run smoothly across different environments.

*6. Database Migrations & Seeding:*
Keeping the database schema and seed data in sync between development and production required careful migration planning. We faced issues with data integrity and rollback strategies during rapid iteration.

*7. Responsive & Accessible UI:*
Designing a modern, responsive, and accessible UI for diverse features (dashboard, marketplace, community) was time-consuming. We had to test across devices and browsers, and implement accessibility best practices for all users.

*8. Team Collaboration & Version Control:*
Coordinating work across team members, managing merge conflicts, and maintaining code quality standards was essential. We set up clear branching strategies and code review processes to streamline collaboration.

*9. Performance Optimization:*
As the app grew, optimizing load times, image processing, and database queries became critical. We used caching, lazy loading, and query optimization to improve user experience.

*10. Documentation & Demo Preparation:*
Preparing clear documentation and a smooth demo for hackathon judges required extra effort. We ensured setup instructions, feature guides, and troubleshooting steps were comprehensive and easy to follow.

## FAQ
*Q:* How do I reset my password?
*A:* Use the Supabase password reset flow on the login page.

*Q:* How do I add new bounties or products?
*A:* Use the dashboard's bounty or marketplace management features.
